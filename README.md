If you have trouble building the app, you might need to update Android Studio to Arctic Fox.

The user is given the option of allowing location permission or denying it and entering a zip code instead.

ListFragmentTest generates screenshots of different states. After you run the test you can pull the screenshots with the adb command: adb pull /storage/emulated/0/Android/data/com.kevin.curritos/files/test_screenshots.

• API Key management
• More testing
• Better offline support
• Better injection practices in tests
• Pagination and refreshing results
